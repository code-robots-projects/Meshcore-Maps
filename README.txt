Dear end user.

These are created for you to do with what you will, at your own risk! 

If they break your machine it’s not my fault! 

T-Decks use 256 x 256 .PNG slippy tiles to generate maps and for free on the Ripple app you can zoom to level 8, which is ok but not great.

As I write I received the T-Decks two days ago and was dismayed to find no easily available maps so I made my own.

I have paid to unlock one of my devices but as yet, have not received the unlock code. I believe these should zoom between OSM levels 5 and 14.

They are created in the OpenTopo style, my primary interest is SAR.
